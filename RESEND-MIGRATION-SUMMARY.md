# Gmail to Resend Migration Summary

## Problem Identified
- **Issue**: Clients were seeing `banningp@gmail.com` in emails instead of the professional `info@paperboyja.com`
- **Cause**: Gmail SMTP overrides the "from" field and shows the authenticated Gmail account
- **Impact**: Unprofessional appearance, brand confusion

## Solution Implemented
**Migrated from Gmail SMTP to Resend API** for email sending in the artwork approval system.

## What Resend Fixes
✅ **Professional sender identity**: Clients only see `PBJA Artwork Team <info@paperboyja.com>`  
✅ **Better deliverability**: Less likely to end up in spam folders  
✅ **No Gmail account visibility**: `banningp@gmail.com` never appears  
✅ **Simpler configuration**: One API key instead of Gmail credentials  
✅ **Generous free tier**: 3,000 emails/month (vs 100/day with SendGrid)  

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
```bash
cd backend && npm install resend
```

### 2. Code Changes
- **Replaced** `nodemailer` with Resend in `backend/server.js`
- **Updated** `sendClientEmail()` function (lines ~236-367)
- **Updated** `sendAdminEmail()` function (lines ~369-495)
- **Made functions async** to support Resend API calls

### 3. Environment Variables
**Updated `env-template.txt`:**
```bash
# OLD Gmail settings (remove these)
EMAIL_USER=banningp@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

# NEW Resend setting (add this)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
```

## Email Functions Modified

### Client Email (when admin uploads artwork)
- **Trigger**: Admin uploads artwork via `/api/upload`
- **Recipient**: Client email address
- **Content**: Professional HTML email with review link
- **Subject**: `"Artwork Approval Request - PBJA - [ArtworkName]"`

### Admin Email (when client responds)
- **Trigger**: Client submits approval/amendment via `/api/review/:id`
- **Recipient**: `info@paperboyja.com`
- **Content**: Client's decision with notes and artwork link
- **Subject**: `"Artwork Approval Response - PBJA - [ArtworkName] - [STATUS]"`

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Get Resend API Key
- Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
- Sign up (free account gives 3,000 emails/month)
- Get API key (starts with `re_`)

### 2. Update Environment Variables
Replace in your `.env` file:
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 3. Domain Verification (Optional but Recommended)
- In Resend dashboard, verify `paperboyja.com` domain
- Ensures emails are sent from your actual domain
- Improves deliverability

## Testing
Once API key is configured:
1. Upload artwork to test client email sending
2. Complete approval flow to test admin email sending
3. Verify emails show only `info@paperboyja.com` as sender

## Benefits Achieved
- **Professional branding**: All emails appear to come from PBJA
- **Better reliability**: Dedicated email service vs Gmail SMTP
- **Simpler setup**: No Gmail app passwords or 2FA issues
- **Cost effective**: Free tier covers expected usage (50-200 emails/month)
- **Modern API**: Cleaner code, better error handling

## Files Modified
- `backend/server.js` - Main email functionality
- `env-template.txt` - Environment variable template
- `backend/package.json` - Added Resend dependency
